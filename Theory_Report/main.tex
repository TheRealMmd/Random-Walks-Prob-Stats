{\Large \color{blue} Theory 1 (Markov's inequality)} \\
{\color{blue} Let X be a continuous random variable with positive values and $a > 0$ . In this case we have:
\begin{center}
    
    $\Bbb{P}[X \ge a] \le \frac{\Bbb{E}[X]}{a} $
\end{center} \\
}
{\color{black} 
We have : \\
\begin{center}
    $\Bbb{E}[X] = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty}{xf_X(x)dx} $  \vspace{0.5cm}\\
    $= \int_{0}^{\infty}{xf_X(x)dx}$  \hspace{1cm}  (since X is positive valued) \vspace{0.25cm}\\
    $\ge \int_{a}^{\infty}{xf_X(x)dx} $ \hspace{1cm} (for any $a \ge 0$ ) \vspace{0.25cm}\\
    $\ge \int_{a}^{\infty}{af_X(x)dx} $ \hspace{1cm} (since $x \ge a$ in the integrated region) \vspace{0.5cm}\\
    $= a \int_{a}^{\infty}{f_X(x)dx}$ \vspace{0.25cm}\\
    $ = a\Bbb{P}[X \ge a] $
\end{center} \\
So we have : \\
\begin{center}
    $\Bbb{E}[X] \ge a\Bbb{P}[X \ge a] \Rightarrow \Bbb{P}[X \ge a] \le \frac{\Bbb{E}[X]}{a} $
\end{center} \\

{\Large \color{blue} Theory 2 } \\
{\color{blue} Changiz has a high skill in hacking and infiltrating information systems. By hacking the city's subway information, he gets access to the origin and destination of all passengers and extracts the passengers' information. Analyzing this information, he realizes that the percentage of people who get off at the "Circus" station in one day can be modeled with a random variable with a mean of 75 and a variance of 25. Also, he found that random variables related to different days are independent from each other. \\ } \newline
{\color{blue}{\large  1.} Find an upper bound for the probability that tomorrow at least 85 \% of the people will get off at the circus station.} \\

We use Markov's inequality and define $a = 85$ : \\
\begin{center}
    $\Bbb{P}[X > 85] \le \frac{\Bbb{E}[X]}{85} = \frac{75}{85} = \frac{15}{17} $
\end{center} \\

{\color{blue}{\large  2.} Find a lower bound for the probability that between 65\% and 85\% of people will get off at the circus station tomorrow. } \\


In this case we define a new random variable $Y = (X - \Bbb{E}[X])^2 $ . We know that $\Bbb{E}[Y] = 25 $ .\\
The problem asks us to find a lower bound for $\Bbb{P}[Y < 100] $ . We use Markov's inequality in this case too : \\

\begin{center}
    \Bbb{P}[Y > 100] \le \frac{\Bbb{E}[Y]}{100} = \frac{25}{100} = \frac{1}{4} \vspace{0.25cm}\\
    $\rightarrow \Bbb{P}[Y > 100] = 1 - \Bbb{P}[Y < 100] $ \vspace{0.25cm}\\
    $\Rightarrow 1 - \Bbb{P}[Y < 100]  \le \frac{1}{4} $ \vspace{0.25cm}\\
    $\Rightarrow \frac{3}{4} \le \Bbb{P}[Y < 100] $
\end{center} \\
We could use Chebyshev's inequality directly too. 

\newpage
{\color{blue}{\large  3.} How many days should we check the information to make sure that with a probability of at least 0.90, the average percentage of people who got off at the circus station during these days was between 70 and 80 percent? } \\
With Chebyshev's inequality we have : \\
\begin{center}
    $\Bbb{P}(|\frac{\sum X_i}{n} - \mu | > \epsilon) \le \frac{\sigma^2}{n\epsilon^2} $ \vspace{0.25cm} \\
    $\Bbb{P}(|\frac{\sum X_i}{n} - \mu | > \epsilon) = 1 - \Bbb{P}(|\frac{\sum X_i}{n} - \mu | \le \epsilon) = 1 - 0.9 = 0.1 $ \vspace{0.25cm} \\
    $n \le \frac{\sigma^2}{\epsilon^2 \Bbb{P}(|\frac{\sum X_i}{n} - \mu | > \epsilon)} = \frac{0.25^2}{0.05^2 \times 0.1} = 250 $
\end{center}

{\Large \color{blue} Theory 3 } \\
{\color{blue} Changiz has also gained access to the information of subway trains. He found out that the number of trains that pass by the station near his house in a period of time Ï„ can be modeled with the help of a random variable X which is $X \sim Poisson(\lambda)$. He also found out that the number of trains in time intervals which do not share with each other, are independent of each other. \\ } \newline
{\color{blue}{\large  1.} We define the random variable $Z_n$ as the number of trains that have passed by the station near Changiz House in the time period $T = n\tau$ . Suppose $k > 1$ . Find an upper bound for the following expression: } \\ \newline
The time $n\tau$ can be separate to $n$ intervals of size $\tau$ . So the number of trains in this time is a random variable $Z_n \sim Poisson(n\lambda)$. Because it's n times sum of $X \sim Poisson(\lambda)$ and we know that the sum of tow poisson random variables has a poisson distribution with $\lambda_1 + \lambda_2 $ . Now we use Markov's inequality : \\
\begin{center}
    $\Bbb{P}[Z_n \ge kn\lambda] \le \frac{\Bbb{E}[Z_n]}{kn\lambda} = \frac{\lambda n}{kn\lambda} = \frac{1}{k}$ \vspace{0.25cm} \\
    $\Rightarrow \Bbb{P}[Z_n \ge kn\lambda]  \le \frac{1}{k}$
\end{center} \\ \newline
{\color{blue}{\large  2.} Suppose $k = 1.25$ , $n = 20$ , $\lambda = 1 $. Estimate the Central Limit Theorem of the previous part with the help of a theorem. } \\ \newline
Like previous part we separate the intervals. suppose that the number of trains in i'th interval is a random variable $X_i$ . With CLT we have : \\ 
\begin{center}
    $\Bbb{P}(\frac{X_1+X_2+...+X_n - n\lambda}{\sqrt{n\lambda}} \le a ) = \Phi(a) $
\end{center} \\
Now we have to find the 'a' : \\
\begin{center}
    $\Bbb{P}(X_1+X_2+...+X_n - n\lambda \le a\sqrt{n\lambda} ) $ \vspace{0.25cm} \\
    $\Bbb{P}(X_1+X_2+...+X_n \le a\sqrt{n\lambda} + n\lambda ) =\Bbb{P}(Z_n \le a\sqrt{n\lambda} + n\lambda )$ \vspace{0.25cm} \\
    $\rightarrow a\sqrt{n\lambda} + n\lambda  = kn\lambda \Rightarrow a = (k-1)\sqrt{n\lambda} $ \vspace{0.25cm} \\
\end{center} \\
So for $a = (k-1)\sqrt{n\lambda} $ we have : \\ 
\begin{center}
    $1 - \Bbb{P}(Z_n \ge kn\lambda) = \Bbb{P}(\frac{X_1+X_2+...+X_n - n\lambda}{\sqrt{n\lambda}} \le a ) = \Phi(a)  $ \\
\end{center} \\
So we have : \\ 
\begin{center}
    $\Bbb{P}(Z_n \ge kn\lambda) = 1 - \Phi((k-1)\sqrt{n\lambda}) = 1 - \Phi(1.118) = 1 - 0.86822 \approx 0.131 $
\end{center} \\ \newline 

{\Large \color{blue} Theory 4 } \\
{\color{blue} We define $Z_n = \sum_{i=1}^{n}{X_i}$ where $X_i$'s are independent random variables with the same distribution. Prove that : \\
\begin{center}
    $\Psi_{Z_n}(s) = n \Psi_X(s) $
\end{center}
\\ } \newline
We have : \\
\begin{center}
    $\Phi_{Z_n}(s) = \Bbb{E}(e^{sX_1+sX_2+...+sX_n}) \Rightarrow $ Because they are independent $ \Rightarrow \prod_{i =1}^{n} \Bbb{E}(e^{sX_i}) $ \vspace{0.25cm}\\
    $\Rightarrow \Phi_{Z_n}(s) = \prod_{i =1}^{n} \Bbb{E}(e^{sX_i}) = \mathbb{E}(e^{sX_i})^n = \Phi_X(s)^n $ \vspace{0.25cm} \\
    $\Rightarrow \Psi_{Z_n} = n \Psi_X(s) $
\end{center} \\

{\Large \color{blue} Theory 5 } \\
{\color{blue} If we assume $s > 0 $ , $\beta > \Bbb{E}[X] $ . Prove that : \\
\begin{center}
    $ e^{-rn} \ge \Bbb{P}[e^{sZ_n} \ge e^{s\beta n}] = \Bbb{P}[Z_n \ge \beta n] $
\end{center} \\
Where $r = sup\{s\beta - \Psi_X(s)\} $ . 
\\ } \newline 
For the first part because $s \ge 0 $ we have : \\
\begin{center}
    $Z_n \ge \beta n \Longleftrightarrow sZ_n \ge s\beta n \Longleftrightarrow e^{sZ_n} \ge e^{s\beta n} $ \vspace{.25cm} \\
    So we have :  $ \Bbb{P}[e^{sZ_n} \ge e^{s\beta n}] = \Bbb{P}[Z_n \ge \beta n] $
\end{center} \\
For second part we use Markov's inequality : \\ 
\begin{center}
    $\Bbb{P}[e^{sZ_n} \ge e^{s\beta n}] \le \frac{\Bbb{E}[e^{sZ_n}]}{e^{s\beta n}} = (\frac{\Bbb{E}[e^{sX}]}{e^{s\beta}})^n = (\frac{\Phi_X(s)}{e^{s\beta }})^n $
\end{center} \\ 
Clearly we have to proof $\frac{\Phi_X(s)}{e^{s\beta }} \le e^{-r} $ : \\
\begin{center}
    $\Longleftrightarrow \frac{\Phi_X(s)}{e^{s\beta }} \le e^{-r} $ \hspace{.3cm} (For all $s \ge 0$) \vspace{.25cm} \\ 
    get ln : $\Rightarrow \Psi_X(s) - s\beta \le -r  $ \vspace{0.25cm} \\
    $ \Longleftrightarrow r \ge s\beta - \Psi_X(s) $
\end{center} \\
Last inequality holds because we have : \hspace{0.5cm} $r = sup\{s\beta - \Psi_X(s)\} $ \\ \newline

{\Large \color{blue} Theory 6 }  \vspace{0.2cm} \\
{\color{blue}{\large 1.} If we assume $X \sim normal(\mu,\sigma^2) $ . Find $\Psi_X(s) $ . } \\
We have : \\
\begin{center}
    $\Bbb{E}(e^{sX}) = M_X(s) = \Bbb{E}(e^{sX}) = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty}e^{sx}\frac{1}{\sigma\sqrt{2\pi}}e^{-\frac{1}{2}(\frac{x-\mu}{\sigma})^2}dx $ \vspace{0.25cm} \\
    $= \frac{1}{\sigma\sqrt{2\pi}}\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}exp\{sx-\frac{1}{2}(\frac{x-\mu}{\sigma})^2\} dx $
\end{center}  \vspace{0.25cm} \\
Substituting $u = \frac{x - \mu}{\sqrt{2}\sigma} $ , we have $ x = \sqrt{2}\sigma u +\mu $ : \\
\begin{center}
    $M_X(s) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{\pi}} \int_{-\infty}^{\infty}exp\{(\sqrt{2}\sigma u +\mu)s - u^2 \} du $\vspace{0.25cm} \\
    $= \frac{e^{s\mu}}{\sqrt{\pi}} \int_{-\infty}^{\infty}exp\{- (u^2 - \sqrt{2}\sigma us )\} du $ \vspace{0.25cm} \\
    $= \frac{e^{s\mu}}{\sqrt{\pi}} \int_{-\infty}^{\infty}exp\{- (u - \frac{\sigma s}{\sqrt{2}})^2 + \frac{1}{2}\sigma^2s^2  \} du $ \vspace{0.25cm} \\
    $= \frac{exp\{s\mu + \frac{1}{2}\sigma^2s^2\}}{\sqrt{\pi}} \int_{-\infty}^{\infty}exp\{- (u - \frac{\sigma s}{\sqrt{2}})^2 \} du $
\end{center} \vspace{0.25cm} \\
Substituting $ v = u - \frac{\sigma s}{\sqrt{2}})^2 $ , clearly we have : \\
\begin{center}
    $M_X(s) = \frac{exp\{s\mu + \frac{1}{2}\sigma^2s^2\}}{\sqrt{\pi}} \int_{-\infty}^{\infty}exp(-v^2) dv $
\end{center} \vspace{0.25cm} \\
With the Gaussian integral we have : \hspace{1cm} $\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}e^{-x^2}dx = \sqrt{\pi} $ \vspace{0.25cm} \\
So we have : \\
\begin{center}
    $M_X(s) = \frac{exp\{s\mu + \frac{1}{2}\sigma^2s^2\}}{\sqrt{\pi}} \int_{-\infty}^{\infty}exp(-v^2) dv  = exp(s\mu + \frac{1}{2}\sigma^2s^2) $ \vspace{0.25cm} \\
    $\Rightarrow \Psi_X(s) = ln(\Bbb{E}[e^{sX}]) = ln(M_X(s)) = s\mu + \frac{1}{2}\sigma^2s^2 $
\end{center}

{\color{blue}{\large 2.} For each random variable X assuming $\Bbb{E}[X] = 0 $ and $|X| < M $ Show: \hspace{1cm} $\Psi_X(s) \le \frac{1}{2}M^2s^2 $ . } \\ 
We prove something stronger : \\
{\color{BrickRed}Lemma :  Suppose that $\Bbb{E}[X] = 0 $ and that $a \le X \le b$ . Then : \hspace{1cm} $\Bbb{E}(e^{sX}) \le e^{\frac{s^2(b-a)^2}{8}} $ } \vspace{0.5cm} \\

{\color{Maroon} Since $a \le X \le b$ , we can write $X$ as a convex combination of $a$ and $b$ , namely $X = \alpha b + (1 - \alpha )a$ where $\alpha = \frac{X - a}{b - a} $ . By convexity of the function $y \rightarrow e^{ys} $ we have : \\
\begin{center}
    $e^{sX} \le \alpha e^{sb} + (1 - \alpha)e^{sa} = \frac{X - a}{b - a}e^{sb} + \frac{b - X}{b-a}e^{sa} $
\end{center} \\
Take expectations of both sides and use the fact $\Bbb{E}[X] = 0 $ to get : \\
\begin{center}
     $e^{sX} \le \frac{ - a}{b - a}e^{sb} + \frac{b }{b-a}e^{sa} = e^{g(u)} $ \hspace{0.5cm} where $u = s(b - a) $
\end{center} \\
we have : $g(u) = -\gamma u + ln(1 - \gamma + \gamma e^u ) $ and $\gamma = \frac{-a}{b - a} $ . \\
Now note that $g(0) = g'(0) = 0 $ . Also $g''(u) \le \frac{1}{4}$ for all $u > 0 $ . \\
By Taylor's theorem , there is a  $\varepsilon \in (0,u) $  : \\
\begin{center}
    $g(u) = g(0) + ug'(0) + \frac{u^2}{2} g''(\varepsilon) = \frac{u^2}{2} g''(\varepsilon) \le \frac{1}{u^2} \times \frac{1}{4} = \frac{u^2}{8} = \frac{s^2(b-a)^2}{8} $ 
\end{center} \\
Finally we have : \\
\begin{center}
    $\Bbb{E}[e^{sX}] \le e^{g(u)} \le e^{\frac{s^2(b-a)^2}{8}} $
\end{center} } \\ 
Because we know that $-M \le X \le M $ taking $a = -M $ and $b = M$ the proof is done. \\ \newline
Another way is : \\ 
\begin{center}
    $1 = \Bbb{P}(|X| < M) = \Bbb{P}(X^2 < M^2) = \Bbb{P}(-X^2 > -M^2) =\Bbb{P}(-sX^2 > -sM^2)$  \vspace{0.3cm} \\
    $= \Bbb{P}(e^{-sX^2} > e^{-sM^2}) \le \frac{\Bbb{E}(e^{-sX^2})}{e^{-sM^2}} $
\end{center}

{\color{blue}{\large 3.} We define $Z_n = \sum_{i=1}^{n}{X_i}$ where $X_i$'s are independent random variables with the same distribution , and we know $ |X_i| \le M $ , $ \beta > \Bbb{E}[X] $ :\\
\begin{center}
    $\Bbb{P}[Z_n \ge \beta n] \le e^{-\frac{\beta ^ 2}{2M^2}n} $
\end{center}
} \\
We have : \\
\begin{center}
    $r = sup\{ s\beta - \Psi_x(s) \} \ge s\beta - \frac{M^2s^2}{2} = f(s)$
\end{center} 
Now we find the maximum of $f(s)$ : \hspace{0.3cm} $\frac{df}{ds} = 0 \rightarrow s = \frac{\beta}{M^2}$ \\
So we can get $r = \frac{\beta^2}{2M^2} $ in {\color{blue}Theory 5} : \\
\begin{center}
    $\Bbb{P}[Z_n \ge \beta n] \le e^{\frac{\beta^2}{2M^2}n} $
\end{center}

{\large \color{blue} First, we want to examine the random walk in one dimension and discover some of its basic properties together. A random walk in one dimension is a stochastic process like $\{Z_n\}_{n = 0}^{+\infty} $ : \\

    $Z_n = Z_0 + \sum_{i = 0}^{n}X_i$

{\color{blue} Changiz enters the subway station. The subway line where Changiz is located has an infinite number of stations, starting from number 1 and continuing to +âˆž. He decides to use a coin with probability p to ride the subway. He tosses the coin, if the result of the coin is a line, he does not get on the subway, and if the result is a lion, he gets on the subway and gets off at the next station. He repeats the same process independently at each station. Let $Z_n$ represent the number of Changiz station after $n$ coin toss. } \\ \newline
{\color{blue} {\large 1. } Find the probability mass function of the random variable $Z_n$ . } \\ \newline
We know he can't go back so if he is at station $Z_0$ at first , $\Bbb{P}[Z_n = k] = 0 $ for $k < Z_0 $ .For $k \ge Z_0 $ we have : \\ 
\begin{center}
    $\Bbb{P}[Z_n = k] = \begin{pmatrix} n \\ k-z_0 \end{pmatrix} p^{k - z_0}(1 - p)^{n - (k - z_0)}  $
\end{center} \newline
{\color{blue} {\large 2. } Find $\Bbb{E}[X_i] $ and Var$[X_i] $ . } \\ \newline
We have : \\
\begin{center}
    $X_i = 
    \begin{cases}
        1 & p \\
        0 & 1-p
    \end{cases}$
\end{center} \\
So $X_i \sim Bernoulli(p)$ and we have : \hspace{0.25cm} $\Bbb{E}[X_i] = p $ \hspace{0.25cm} Var$[X_i] = p(1-p) $  \\ \newline

{\color{blue} {\large 3. } Find $\Bbb{E}[Z_n] $ and Var$[Z_n] $ . } \\ \newline
We have : \\
\begin{center}
    $\Bbb{E}[Z_n] = \Bbb{E}[Z_0 + X_1 + X_2 + ... + X_n] = z_0 + n\Bbb{E}[X_i] = z_0 + np  $
\end{center} \\
For Var$[Z_n] $ first we calculate $\Bbb{E}[Z_n^2] $ : \\
\begin{center}
    $\Bbb{E}[Z_n^2] = z_0^2 + 2z_0 \Bbb{E}[X_1 + X_2 + ... + X_n] + \Bbb{E}[(X_1 + X_2 + ... + X_n)^2] = z_0^2 + 2z_0 np + n\Bbb{E}[X_i^2] + 2\begin{pmatrix}n \\ 2 \end{pmatrix} p^2  $ \vspace{0.2cm} \\
    $\Bbb{E}[Z_n^2] = z_0^2 + 2z_0 np + np + 2\begin{pmatrix}n \\ 2 \end{pmatrix} p^2 $
\end{center} \\
So we have : \\
\begin{center}
    Var$[Z_n] = \Bbb{E}[Z_n^2] - \Bbb{E}[Z_n]^2 = np + 2\begin{pmatrix}n \\ 2 \end{pmatrix} p^2 - n^2p^2 =  np(1 - p) $ 
\end{center} \\ \newline 
{\color{blue} {\large 4. } How do you feel about $\Bbb{E}[Z_n] $ ? What does this component describe? } \\ \newline 
As we described this is the sum of the first station and the expected of n Bernoulli variables because the $X_i$'s are independent . It describes the number of heads we expect to see after n tosses . \\

At n'th step he is in station $z$ if he was at $z-1$ or $z+1$ at the (n-1)'th step. So we have : \\

We define $p_0 $ the probability of reaching zoo when he is at station 0 and $p_1 $ the probability of reaching zoo when he is at station 1. we have : \hspace{0.1cm} $p_0 = 0 + \frac{1}{2}p_1 $  \hspace{0.1cm} and \hspace{0.1cm}  $p_1 = \frac{1}{2}p_0 + \frac{1}{2} $ \\

Like previous part we have $T_0 = 0 $ , $T_l = 0 $ and $T_i = 1 + pT_{i+1} + (1-p)T_{i-1} $ . we have : \\
\begin{center}
    $T_i - T_{i-1} = 1 + p(T_{i+1} - T_i + T_i - T_{i-1}) \rightarrow K_i = 1 + p(K_{i+1} + K_i) $ \vspace{0.2cm} \\

Solve this with $T_0 = 0 $ , $T_l = 0 $ and previous part we have : \\ 
\begin{center}
    $T_n = \frac{n}{1-2p} - \frac{l}{1-2p} . \frac{(\frac{q}{p})^n - 1}{(\frac{q}{p})^l - 1} $

If $p = \frac{1}{2} $ : 
\begin{center}
    $2T_i = 2 + T_{i-1} + T_{i+1} $

because of symmetry ($p = \frac{1}{2}$) we have : $T_1 = T_{l-1} = n-1 $ . \\
Now with induction we have : \hspace{0.5cm} $T_i = i(n-i) $ \\ \newline
For maximum expected ,  for $p \neq \frac{1}{2} $ we derivate the solution and we get $n$ such that : \\
\begin{center}
    $ \frac{1}{1-2p} - \frac{l}{1-2p} . \frac{ln(\frac{q}{p})}{(\frac{q}{p})^l -1}.(\frac{q}{p})^n = 0 $ \vspace{0.2cm} \\
    $(\frac{q}{p})^n = \frac{l}{ln(\frac{q}{p})}.((\frac{q}{p})^l -1)  $  \vspace{0.2cm} \\ 
    $ln(\frac{q}{p}) n = ln(\frac{l}{ln(\frac{q}{p})}.((\frac{q}{p})^l -1)) $ \vspace{0.2cm} \\  
    $\Rightarrow n = ln(\frac{l(\frac{p}{q})}{ln(\frac{q}{p})}.((\frac{q}{p})^l -1)) $

So we get the nearest natural number to $n$ . \\ 
for $p = \frac{1}{2} $ clearly we have for $\lfloor \frac{n}{2} \rfloor $ we have maximum expected. \\ \newline

{\color{blue} Suppose the metro line has infinite stations numbered from $0$ to $+ \infty$. Changiz gets on the subway at station number n and in each step, independently of the previous steps, he moves forward right by one station and back by one station with probability $p âˆ’ 1 = q$. He gets out of the subway as soon as he reaches station number 0. } \\ \newline 

{\color{blue} {\large 1. }We denote the probability of him leaving the subway assuming he starts from station $n$ by $p_n$. Calculate $p_n$. Is it possible that he will never leave the subway? } \\ \newline
With recursive relations we have : \hspace{0.1cm} $p_n = p\times p_{n+1} + q\times p_{n-1} $ \\
So we solve this recursive equation : \\ 
\begin{center}
    $p\alpha^2 - \alpha + q = 0  $ \vspace{0.2cm} \\ 
    $\alpha = \frac{1 \pm \sqrt{1 - 4pq}}{2p} = \frac{1 \pm |1 - 2p|}{2p} $ \vspace{0.2cm} \\
    $\rightarrow \alpha_1 = \frac{1 + |1 - 2p|}{2p}  $ / $ \alpha_2 = \frac{1 - |1 - 2p|}{2p} $ \vspace{0.2cm} \\
    $\Rightarrow p_n = a\alpha_1^n + b \alpha_2^n $ 
\end{center} \\ 
Now : \\
$p \le \frac{1}{2} \rightarrow |1 - 2p| = 1 - 2p $ : \\ 
\begin{center}
    $p_n = a (\frac{1-p}{p})^n + b 1^n  = a (\frac{1-p}{p})^n + b $
\end{center} \\ 
We know that $p_0 = 1$ so $a+b = 1 $ . Now because $q>\frac{1}{2} $ Changiz expect to get closer to 0 so we have $p_{\infty} = 1 $ so $\Rightarrow b = 1 $ and $a = 0 $ . So we have : \\
\begin{center}
    $p_n = 1 $
\end{center} \\
$p > \frac{1}{2} \rightarrow |1 - 2p| = 2p - 1 $ : \\
\begin{center}
    $p_n = a 1^n + b(\frac{1-p}{p})^n = a + b(\frac{1-p}{p})^n  $
\end{center} \\ 
In this case we have : $a+b = 0 $ and $p_{\infty} = 0 $ , so $\rightarrow a = 0 $ and $b = 1 $ . So we  have : \\
\begin{center}
    $p_n = (\frac{q}{p})^n $
\end{center} \\
As we see if $p > \frac{1}{2} $ at a large enough $n > N$ we can say he \textbf{can't} exit. \\ \newline 

{\color{blue} {\large 2. }The expected value of the number of steps required to get off the subway (at station 0), when Changiz's movement has started from station $n$, we denote by $t_n$, get $t_n$. Check your answer in the cases $q = p$ and $q > p$. } \\ \newline

We have : \hspace{0.2cm} $T_n = 1 + pT_{n+1} + qT_{n-1} $ \\
\begin{center}
    $T_n - T_{n-1} = 1 + p(T_{n+1} - T_n + T_n - T_{n-1}) $ \hspace{0.05cm} define : $S_n = T_n - T_{n-1} $ \vspace{0.2cm} \\
    $S_n = 1 + p(S_{n+1} + S_n) \rightarrow (1 - p)S_n = 1 + pS_{n+1} $ \hspace{0.05cm} define: $ K_n = S_n + \frac{1}{1 - 2p} $ \vspace{0.2cm} \\
    $qK_n = p K_{n+1} \rightarrow K_{n+1} = \frac{q}{p}K_n \Rightarrow K_n = (\frac{q}{p})^{n-1}K_1 $ \vspace{0.2cm} \\
    $T_n = (\frac{(\frac{q}{p})^n - 1}{\frac{q}{p} - 1})(T_1  + \frac{1}{1-2p}) - \frac{n}{1 - 2p} $ 
\end{center} \\
Now we expect that for $p>q $ for $T_n(n \rightarrow \infty)$ we have $T_n = \infty$ as we see. \\
But for $p = q = \frac{1}{2} $ we can't find $T_n$ because we don't have boundary conditions and can't define $\frac{1}{1 - 2p} $ . \\

{\color{blue} Suppose the subway line has infinite stations numbered from $\infty$ to $+\infty$. Changiz enters the subway at station number 0.

{\color{blue} {\large 1. }Changiz's complex movements can be modeled with his simpler movements.

We can define random variables $X_i$'s as single steps so we have : \\

    $Y_n = X_1 + X_2 + ... + X_n $

Where $Y_n$ is the destination after n steps. \\

{\color{blue} {\large 2. }We denote the probability that Changiz will reach station number k at some point of his movement with $p_k$, that is:

    $p_k = \Bbb{P}[\exists n \in \Bbb{N} : Z_n = k ] $

\begin{center}
    $p_1 = p + qp_2$
\end{center} Argue why this relationship is true? } \\ \newline 
Because to reach station $1$ he has to be in station $0$ or $2$ in his previous state. So the probability of being in station 1 is sum of $p \times p_0 $ and $q \times p_2 $ (because if he is in station 2 with the probability of $q$ moves to station 1 ). Note that the first station is 0 so $p_0$ . So we have : \\
\begin{center}
    $p_1 = pp_0 + qp_2 = p + qp_2 $

{\color{blue} {\large 3. }According to the previous parts, get a quadratic equation to calculate $p_1$ and solve it. Discuss the roots obtained in terms of p and q. For what values of p and q are each of the roots valid? } \\ \newline 
Because the first station is $0$ , to reach station $2$ we have to reach station $1$ first . when we reach station $1$ we can say it's the origin so the probability to reach station 2 from station 1 is the same probability of reach station 1 from station 0 . So we have : $p_2 = p_1^2 $ . \\ 
So we have : \hspace{0.2cm} $p_1 = p + qp_1^2 $ . \\

\begin{center}
    $\Bbb{E}[N] < \infty $

We assume that $\Bbb{E}[N] > \infty $ but with Law of Large Numbers we have $lim_{n \to \infty} X_1 + X_2 + ... + X_n = n\Bbb{E}[X_i] > 0 $ So the $ X_1 + X_2 + ... + X_n $ can't be negative for infinite numbers! So  $\Bbb{E}[N] < \infty $ . \\


{\color{blue} {\large 3.} We denote the position of the machine in the $n$'th stage with $Z_n = Z_0 + \sum_{i=1}^{n} $. If we define $R_n$ as the number of distinct values $(Z_0,Z_1,Z_2,...,Z_n)$ then show:\\
\begin{center}
    $\lim_{n\to\infty} \frac{\Bbb{E}[R_n]}{n} = \Bbb{P}[$never returns to 0$]$

We define the random variable $Y_i$ , $Y_i$ is the station he see in the i'th step. We get $Y_i = 1$ when we know we won't see that station again. Otherwise thats $Y_i = 0$ . So we have $R_n = \sum_{i=1}^{n} Y_i $ 
\begin{center}
    $\Bbb{E}[R_n] = \sum_{i=1}^{n} \Bbb{E}[Y_i] = n \Bbb{E}[Y_i] \Rightarrow \frac{\Bbb{E}[R_n]}{n} = \Bbb{E}[Y_i] = 1 \times \Bbb{P}[Y_i] $
\end{center}
So we have : $lim_{n \to \infty} \frac{\Bbb{E}[R_n]}{n} = \Bbb{P}[Y_i] $ \\
As we defined we can say $\Bbb{P}[Y_i]$ is the exactly what we want. \\

{\color{blue} Suppose the taxi goes forward one unit with probability $\frac{1}{2}$ and back one unit with probability $\frac{1}{2}$ in each step. Also, assume that the taxi is initially at the position $Z_0 = 0 $. Prove that for each $ k \neq 0 $, the expected of the number of times that the taxi position is equal to $k$ before the taxi position becomes zero again is equal to 1. } \\ \newline 
We define to co-probabilities to be more comfortable : \\ $q_k$ : the probability of start from 0 station come back to station 0 without reaching the k'th station. \\
$s_k$ : start from station 0 and reach the k'th station without seeing station 0 again. \\
First for $q_k$'s we have : 
\begin{center}
    $q_k = \frac{1}{4}(1 + q_{k-1} + q_{k-1}^2 + q_{k-1}^3 + ...) $
\end{center} 
Because first with the probability of $\frac{1}{2}$ he moves to station 1 . Then he can goes back with probability of $\frac{1}{2}$ or he goes forward and the probability of see station 1 , i times without seeing station k is $q_{k-1}^i $ then with probability $\frac{1}{2}$ he back to zero. So we have : 
\begin{center}
    $q_k = \frac{1}{4}(\frac{1}{1 - q_{k-1}}) $
\end{center} 
Now note that we know $q_1 = 0$ . We can simply see that we have : $q_k = \frac{k-1}{2k} $ \vspace{0.3cm} \\
Proof : By induction we have : $q_{k+1} = \frac{1}{4}(\frac{1}{1 - \frac{k-1}{2k}}) = \frac{1}{4}(\frac{2k}{k+1}) = \frac{k}{2(k+1)} $ . \\
Now we calculate $s_k$'s. We have : 
\begin{center}
    $s_k = \frac{1}{2} s_{k-1}(1 + q_{k-1} + q_{k-1}^2 + ... ) $
\end{center} 
Similarly , with probability of $\frac{1}{2}$ he gets station 1 then it's the matter of how many time's he see station 1 again ($q_{k-1}^i $) and then we have $S_{k-1}$ to reach station without seeing station 1 again. So we have : 
\begin{center}
    $s_k = \frac{1}{2} s_{k-1} \frac{1}{1 - q_{k-1}} = \frac{k-1}{k}s_{k-1} $
\end{center}
We have $s_1 = \frac{1}{2}$ with induction clearly we have : \hspace{0.2cm} $s_k = \frac{1}{2k} $ \\
Now we want to calculate the expected times of seeing the k'th station without before reaching 0 station Name this variable $W_k$ we have : \\
\begin{center}
    $\Bbb{E}[W_k] = \sum_{i=1}^{\infty} i s_k^2(q_k + \frac{1}{2})^{i-1} $
\end{center} 
Note that the probability of seeing the $k$'th station exactly $i$ times is : 
\begin{center}
    $\frac{1}{2}$ (goes the actual side) \vspace{0.3cm} \\
    $\times$ $s_k$ (see station k from station zero without see zero again) \vspace{0.3cm} \\
    $\times (q_k + \frac{1}{2})^{i-1} $ (see station k $i-1$ times without seeing zero. note that from left side is $q_{k}$ and from right is $lim_{k \to \infty} q_k = \frac{1}{2} $) \vspace{0.3cm} \\
    $\times s_k$  (back to station zero without seeing station k again)
\end{center}    
So we have : \\
\begin{center}
    $\Bbb{E}[W_k] = \sum_{i=1}^{\infty} i s_k^2(q_k + \frac{1}{2})^{i-1} = (\frac{1}{2k})^2 {\color{orange} \sum_{i=1}^{\infty} i (1 - \frac{1}{2k})^{i-1}} $ \vspace{0.3cm} \\
    $\Rightarrow {\color{orange} \sum_{i=1}^{\infty} i (1 - \frac{1}{2k})^{i-1} = \frac{d}{da} \frac{1}{1 - a} = \frac{1}{(1-a)^2} = \frac{1}{(\frac{1}{2k})^2} = (2k)^2 }$ \vspace{0.4cm} \\
    $\Bbb{E}[W_k] = (\frac{1}{2k})^2 (2k)^2 = 1 $
\end{center}
So we have $\Bbb{E}[W_k] = 1 $ for every $k$ as we wanted. \\

We know if his motion is faithful then we have $\Bbb{P}[R] =1 $ so he will come back every time he leaves, when he back to station 0 we can restart his motion but at this state we have $N += N $ . We can do it infinite time. \\ 
If he returns to the origin almost certainly an infinite number of times , then we have $\Bbb{P}[R] =1 $ so his motion is faithful. \\

{\Large \color{blue} Theory 23 } \\
{\color{blue} We show the number of Changiz station in the n-th stage with the random variable $Z_n$. We assume that his movement starts from the origin . He moves one station forward with a probability of $\frac{1}{2}$ and he goes back one station with a probability of $\frac{1}{2}$ in each stage independently of the previous stages. We define event $A_x$ as "Changiz arriving at station $-x-1$ earlier than at station $x âˆ’ M$". In other words, the event $A_x$ occurs when the event $Z_n = -1 -x $ occurs earlier than the event $Z_n = M - x $. We define the function $f$ as follows:
\begin{center}
    $f : \{ -1,0,...,M-1,M \} \to R $ \\
    $f(x) = \Bbb{P}[A_x] $
\end{center} 
According to the definition, it is obvious that: $f(M) = 0 $ , $f(-1) = 1 $ . Show that : 
\begin{center}
    $f(x) = \frac{1}{2}f(x+1) + \frac{1}{2}f(x-1) $

Now calculate $f(x)$ . 
} \\ \newline 
By definition we have all of $f(x) = f(x-1) = f(x+1) = $ the probability of reaching $-1-x $ before $M-x $ from their station. So we have : $f(x) = \frac{1}{2}f(x+1) + \frac{1}{2}f(x-1) $ \\ So this problem is like gambler problem with $\frac{1}{2} $ and we have $P_x = f(x) = \frac{M-x}{M+1} $ . \\

{\color{blue} {\large 1. }Calculate the value of $f(0)$ and write its probabilistic interpretation. } \\ \newline
As we had in previous problem : $f(0) = \frac{M}{M+1}$ . It's the probability of reaching $-1$ before $M$ . like gambler problem , the probability of losing with $p = \frac{1}{2}$ and you have 1 coin and you win when you have $M+1$ coins. \\ 

{\color{blue} {\large 2. }Given that the event "never reaching station âˆ’1" is equivalent to the event "arriving at station M earlier than station âˆ’1 for every $N \in M$" and the relation you obtained for $f(0)$, argue that With a probability of 1, Changiz will almost certainly go to station -1. } \\ \newline
We have $f(0) = \frac{M}{M+1}$ so if $M \to \infty $ then $f(0) = 1 $ . So the probability of reaching station $-1$ before large M's is 1 . that's that the probability of reachin $-1$ when $M \to \infty$ . \\ 

{\color{blue} {\large 3. }Using symmetry and a little reasoning, show that Changiz's move is faithful. } \\ \newline
Because $p = q = \frac{1}{2} $ .Using previous part we have that if we were at station 1 the probability of reaching station 0 is 1. By symmetry we have that if we were at station -1 the probability of reaching station 0 is 1. So $P_1 = P_{-1} = 1 $ : 
\begin{center}
    $\Bbb{P}[R] = pP_{-1} + qP_1 = 1 $

So Changiz's move is faithful.

The law of large numbers says :

Using {\color{blue} Theory 22} if the movement is faithful we have $\sum_{i=1}^{n} X_i = 0 $ for infinity $n$'s . Then we have $\exists n > N : \sum_{i=1}^{n} X_i = 0$ for every $N$ . So : 
\begin{center}
    $0 =lim_{n\to \infty} X_1 + ... + X_n = lim_{n\to \infty} \frac{X_1 + ... + X_n}{n} = \Bbb{E}[X] $

    $\sum_{z= -2M\sqrt{n}}^{2M\sqrt{n}} m(z) = \sum_{z= -2M\sqrt{n}}^{2M\sqrt{n}} \sum_{i=0}^{n} \Bbb{P} [Z_i = z] = \sum_{i=0}^{n} \sum_{z= -2M\sqrt{n}}^{2M\sqrt{n}} \Bbb{P} [Z_i = z] $ \vspace{0.3cm} \\ 
    $\Rightarrow \sum_{z= -2M\sqrt{n}}^{2M\sqrt{n}} m(z) = \sum_{i=0}^{n} \Bbb{P}[|Z_i| < 2M\sqrt{n}] \ge \sum_{i=0}^{n} \frac{1}{2} = \frac{n}{2} $
\end{center}

{\color{blue} {\large 3. }Now, considering $m(0) \ge m(z) $, show that if we have for each $z \in \Bbb{Z} : m(z) \le + \infty$, the result of {\color{blue}Section 2} leads to a contradiction, and thus the motion Random with condition $\Bbb{E}[X_i] = 0 $ is loyal.
} \\ \newline
Using $m(0) \ge m(z) $ we have : 
\begin{center}
    $\sum_{z= -2M\sqrt{n}}^{2M\sqrt{n}} m(0) = 4M\sqrt{n}m(0) \ge \sum_{z= -2M\sqrt{n}}^{2M\sqrt{n}} m(z) \ge \frac{n}{2} $ \\
    $m(0) \ge \frac{\sqrt{n}}{8M} $
\end{center} 
Now if we $n \to \infty $ we have $m(0) \to \infty $ But that's a contradiction with $z \in \Bbb{Z} : m(z) \le + \infty$ ! So the the motion Random with condition $\Bbb{E}[X_i] = 0 $ is loyal. \\

{\color{blue} Using Stirling's approximation, it can be shown: 
\begin{center}
    $\frac{4^n}{\sqrt{\pi (n+\frac{1}{2})}} \le \begin{pmatrix}
        2n \\ n
    \end{pmatrix} \le \frac{4^n}{\sqrt{\pi n}} $ .
\end{center} 
Using this inequality on the even stages of Changiz's random motion, argue that for a 2D network his motion is faithful and for a 3D network his motion is unfaithful.
} \\ \newline 
We have : 
\begin{center}
    $\Bbb{P}[Z_{2n} = 0] = \begin{pmatrix}
        2n \\ n
    \end{pmatrix} \frac{1}{4^n} $
\end{center}
With the Stirling's approximation we have : 
\begin{center}
    $\frac{1}{\sqrt{\pi (n+\frac{1}{2})}} \le \begin{pmatrix}
        2n \\ n
    \end{pmatrix} \frac{1}{4^n} \le \frac{1}{\sqrt{\pi n}} $
\end{center} 
Now with sandwitch theorem we can say that : 
\begin{center}
    $\Bbb{E}[N] = \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \Bbb{P}[Z_{2n} = 0] \sim \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \frac{1}{\sqrt{n}}   \rightarrow \infty$
\end{center} 
Now with {\color{blue} Theory 22} we can say that his movement is faithful. \\
For d-Dimentional we have : \\
\begin{center}
    $(\frac{1}{\sqrt{\pi (n+\frac{1}{2})}})^d \le \Bbb{P}[Z_{2n} = 0] \le (\frac{1}{\sqrt{\pi n}})^d $
\end{center} 
So the expected for that is $\sim $ power-series with $-\frac{d}{2}$ where it's divergent for $d \le 2 $ and it's converge for $d >2 $ . So for $d>2 $ his movement is not faithful. \\


{\Large \color{blue} Theory 30 } \\
{\color{blue} Assume that the movement of Changiz in each stage is independent from the previous stages, and the probability density function of Genghis' movement in each stage is as follows: 
\begin{center}
    $f_{X_n}(x_n) = \frac{1}{(2\pi \sigma^2)^\frac{3}{2}}exp(-\frac{x_n^Tx_n}{2\sigma^2}) $
\end{center}
That means, in each step, Genghis moves randomly with a Gaussian distribution. \\
Assuming that Changiz was initially at the origin of coordinates, obtain the probability mass function of his location in the n-th step.($f_{Z_n}(Z_n) $)
} \\ \newline 
We have $Z_n = \sum_{i=1}^{n} $ so if $X_i \sim N(0,\sigma^2) \Rightarrow Z_n \sim N(0,n\sigma^2) $ : 
\begin{center}
    $f_{Z_n}(Z_n) = \frac{1}{(2\pi n\sigma^2)^\frac{3}{2}}exp(-\frac{z_n^Tz_n}{2n\sigma^2})$
\end{center}

{\Large \color{blue} Theory 31 } \\
{\color{blue} We want to see what the distribution of his location looks like in large $n$. Therefore, we can assume that, on average, in each step, it does not have a very large displacement compared to its distance from the origin. Therefore, in the integral of the relation (1), we can expand the term $f_{Z_{n-1}}(z_n - x_n) $ with respect to the vector $x_n$. Do this expansion up to the second order and write the obtained expression for $f_{Z_n}(z_n) $. \\
{\small Hint: In the expansion of a scalar function with respect to a vector up to the second order, the quantities of the gradient vector and the Hessian matrix appear.}

    $f_{Z_{n-1}}(z_n - x_n) = f_{Z_{n-1}}(Z_n) + x_n^T \nabla f_{Z_{n-1}}(z_n) + \frac{1}{2}x_n^T H_{Z_{n-1}}(z_n)(x_n) $ \vspace{0.3cm}\\
    $f_{Z_n} (z_n) = \int_{\Bbb{R}^3}f_{X_n}(x_n)f_{Z_{n-1}}(z_n - x_n) dx_n $ \vspace{0.3cm} \\

    $ = f_{Z_{n-1}}(z_n) + \frac{1}{2}\int_{\Bbb{R}^3}f_{X_n}(x_n)x_n^T H_{Z_{n-1}}(z_n)(x_n) dx_n  $
\end{center} 
We calculate second integral : 
\begin{center}
    $\int_{\Bbb{R}^3}f_{X_n}(x_n)x_n^T H_{Z_{n-1}}(z_n)(x_n) dx_n = \sum_{i=1}^{n} \sum_{j=1}^{n} [H_{Z_{n-1}}]_{ij} {\color{purple} \int_{\Bbb{R}^3}f_{X_n} x_{ni}x_{nj}dx_n} =  \sum_{i=1}^{n} \sum_{j=1}^{n} [H_{Z_{n-1}}]_{ij} {\color{purple} \sigma^2 \delta_{ij}} $
\end{center} \\
We have : 
\begin{center}
    $\delta_{ij} = $ \begin{cases}
        1 \hspace{0.3cm} $i=j$ \\
        0 \hspace{0.3cm} o.w
    \end{cases} 
\end{center} \\
So we can write : \\
\begin{center}
    $\int_{\Bbb{R}^3}f_{X_n}(x_n)x_n^T H_{Z_{n-1}}(z_n)(x_n) dx_n = \sigma^2 trace(H_{Z_{n-1}}(z_n)) $
\end{center} \\
So we have : \\
\begin{center}
    $f_{Z_n} (z_n) =  f_{Z_{n-1}}(z_n) + \frac{\sigma^2}{2}trace(H_{Z_{n-1}}(z_n)) $ \vspace{0.3cm} \\
    $f_{Z_n} (z_n) =  f_{Z_{n-1}}(z_n) + \frac{\sigma^2}{2} \nabla^2 f_{Z_{n-1}}(z_n) $

From previous problem we have : \\
\begin{center}
    $f_{Z_n} (z_n) =  f_{Z_{n-1}}(z_n) + \frac{\sigma^2}{2}trace(H_{Z_{n-1}}(z_n)) $ \vspace{0.3cm}\\
    $\Rightarrow {\color{cyan} f_{Z_t} (z_t)} = [{\color{cyan} f_{Z_t} (z_t)} - \frac{\partial}{\partial t}f_{Z_t} (z_t)\delta t ] + \frac{\sigma^2}{2}trace(H_{Z_{n-1}}(z_n)) $ \vspace{0.3cm} \\
    $\Rightarrow \frac{\partial f_{Z_t}}{\partial t} = \frac{s}{2}trace(H_{Z_{n-1}}(z_n)) $ \vspace{0.3cm} \\
    $\Rightarrow \frac{\partial f_{Z_t}}{\partial t} = \frac{s}{2}\nabla^2 f_{Z_t} $

So we get $\alpha = \frac{s}{2}$ \\

\begin{center}
    $\tilde{F}(l) = F\{ f_{Z_t}(z_t) \} $ \vspace{0.3cm} \\
    $\Rightarrow \frac{d\tilde{F}(l)}{dt} = -\frac{s}{2}l^2 \tilde{F}(l) $ \vspace{0.3cm} \\
    $\tilde{F}(l) = C e^{-\frac{sk^Tkt}{2}} $
\end{center} \\
Because we know at time $t=0$ he's at station 0 . $C =0 \Rightarrow \tilde{F}(l) = e^{-\frac{sl^Tlt}{2}}$ \\
\begin{center}
    $f_{Z_t}(z_t) = (\frac{1}{2\pi})^3 \int_{\Bbb{R}^3} e^{-\frac{sl^Tlt}{2}} e^{jl^Tx}d^3l  $ \vspace{0.3cm} \\
    $=(\frac{1}{2\pi})^3 \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} e^{jl_x x}e^{-\frac{st}{2}k_x^2}dk_x \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} e^{jl_y y}e^{-\frac{st}{2}l_y^2}dl_y \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} e^{jl_z z}e^{-\frac{st}{2}l_z^2}dl_z $

Now it's 1D and we can solve it : \\ 
\begin{center}
    $(\frac{1}{2\pi st})^{\frac{1}{2}} e^{-\frac{x^2}{2st}} \Longleftrightarrow \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi}}e^{\frac{stx^2}{2}} $

So we have : 
\begin{center}
    $f_{Z_t}(z_t) = (\frac{1}{2\pi st})^{\frac{3}{2}} e^{-\frac{x^2+y^2+z^2}{2st}} $

{\color{blue} The density function of the size of the distance from the origin of coordinates, that is, $f_{||z_t||}(r)$ is the average size of the distance from the origin, Get the coordinate, i.e. $E[||z_t||]$, and its variance, i.e. $Var[\Vert z_t \Vert]$.
} \\ \newline 
From last problem we can say $r^2 = x^2+y^2+z^2 $ where $r$ is that distance. So we have : 
\begin{center}
    $f_{Z_t}(r) = \frac{4\pi r^2}{(2\pi st)^{\frac{3}{2}}}e^{-\frac{r^2}{2st}} $ 
\end{center} 
We have : 
\begin{center}
    $\Bbb{E}[\Vert Z_t \Vert ] = \int_{0}^{\infty} r\frac{4\pi r^2}{(2\pi st)^{\frac{3}{2}}}e^{-\frac{r^2}{2st}} dr = \frac{4\pi }{(2\pi st)^{\frac{3}{2}}} \int_{0}^{\infty} r^3 e^{-\frac{r^2}{2st}} dr$
\end{center} 
We get $u = \frac{r^2}{2st} \rightarrow du = \frac{r}{st}dr  $ : \\
\begin{center}
    $\Bbb{E}[\Vert Z_t \Vert ] = \frac{4\pi }{(2\pi st)^{\frac{3}{2}}} \int_{0}^{\infty} 2s^2t^2 ue^{-u} du = \frac{8\pi s^2t^2 }{(2\pi st)^{\frac{3}{2}}} {\color{orange} \int_{0}^{\infty}  ue^{-u} du} = \frac{8\pi s^2t^2 }{(2\pi st)^{\frac{3}{2}}} {\color{orange} 1 }= \sqrt{\frac{8st}{\pi}} $

Now we need $ \Bbb{E}[\Vert Z_t \Vert^2 ] $ to calculate $Var[\Vert Z_t \Vert]$ . \\
\begin{center}
    $\Bbb{E}[\Vert Z_t \Vert^2 ] = \int_{0}^{\infty} r^2 \frac{4\pi r^2}{(2\pi st)^{\frac{3}{2}}}e^{-\frac{r^2}{2st}} dr = \frac{4\pi }{(2\pi st)^{\frac{3}{2}}} {\color{orange} \int_{0}^{\infty} r^4 e^{-\frac{r^2}{2st}} dr} = \frac{4\pi }{(2\pi st)^{\frac{3}{2}}} \times {\color{orange} \frac{3\sqrt{\pi}}{\sqrt{2} (\frac{1}{st})^{\frac{5}{2}}} } = 3st $

So we have : \\
\begin{center}
    $Var[\Vert z_t \Vert] =\Bbb{E}(\Vert Z_t \Vert^2 ) - \Bbb{E}(\Vert Z_t \Vert )^2 = 3st = \frac{8st}{\pi} = (3 - \frac{8}{\pi})st$

We had : $f_{Z_t}(z_t) = (\frac{1}{2\pi st})^{\frac{3}{2}} e^{-\frac{x^2+y^2+z^2}{2st}} = f_{Z_t}(z_t) = (\frac{1}{2\pi st})^{\frac{3}{2}} e^{-\frac{z_n^Tz_n}{2st}}$ So we can similarly prove that : \\
